# Asteroid-Collision-Microbit
The Asteroid Collision project is a Python-based game designed for use with a micro:bit for McMaster Engineering's Venture Academy. 

A micro:bit is a Single Board Computer (SBC) that consists of light displays, buttoms, sensors, and I/O features that can be programmed to complete a given task, integrating software and hardware. In the Asteroid Collision Game, players control a spaceship by tilting the micro:bit sensed by the onboard accelerometer to avoid asteroids falling from random columns. The movement is constrained within the 5 x 5 LED grid and the game ends when the player reaches 10 points.

The project consists of fundamental programming and microcontroller concepts and was instructed to 150+ students in the community.
